# The Architect - Introduction

The Architect is cloud software running at [agentsofthesystem.com](https://agentsofthesystem.com), and it's primary
purpose is to colocate friend groups and their dedicated servers into one application.  Users attach Agent Smith
instances and share them with friend groups via a Web Graphical User Interface (GUI).  The Architect seeks to automate
as much management tasks for dedicated servers as possible, such as monitoring for updates.  At a minimum friend
groups may more easily collaborate to maintain a server, even if that's a manual endeavor.  To alert users of any
information, The Architect uses emails as a form of communicating to the entire group regarding a specific agent.
That way everyone stays in the loop and everyone has a chance to act, if necessary.
