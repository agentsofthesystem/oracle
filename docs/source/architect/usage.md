# User Guide

The area of documentation seeks to inform the end user the basics for using The Architect, and is not
intended for a developer.

## Where to get the software.

There is no download for using The Architect, you will use a web browser to access the tool:

[agentsofthesystem.com](https://agentsofthesystem.com)

## Account Creation

NOTE: The Architect is optimized for both a desktop and mobile browser. Only A single account is needed for both.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the [signup](https://agentsofthesystem.com/signup) page.
2. Sign up with your email.  If you have already registered, click "Log in here" at the bottom.


## User Preferences

After registering, the user gets the option to designate some preferences.

* Open a browser and navigate to the [preferences](https://agentsofthesystem.com/app/preferences) page after registering.

There are categories of preferences separated visually.  Here are the most notable:

1. Notification Preferences - The user has the option to opt-out of Direct Messages
   and/or Email of various types.
2. Time Preferences - The user's timezone, 12 vs 24 hour time format, etc...

Preferences are available to the user regardless of being a subscribed user or not.

## Messaging / Notifications

Messages take the form of two types.

1. Direct Messages - These are messages that appear within the application.  The user
   must be signed in, navigate to the [Messages](https://agentsofthesystem.com/app/messages) page,
   and click to view individual messages shown in a table.  Messages are considered either all
   un-read or all read.  When the user clicks "Mark all read" then all messages recieved will
   disappear from the message table(s).

2. Emails - Some Direct Messages also simultaneously are sent out as emails to the user's email
   provided at sign up.  Other emails are system emails, such as the welcome email that aren't
   tied to any specific notification.

The user has the option to opt-out of any or all email messages on the [Preferences](https://agentsofthesystem.com/app/preferences)
page.

## Adding Agents

Please see Step 4 in the Getting Started Guide.  TODO - Add link.

## Adding Friends

* Open a browser and navigate to the [Friends](https://agentsofthesystem.com/app/friends) page.

In order to send a friend request, one needs a friend code.  Those codes are obtained by your
friend and may be found on the [dashboard](https://agentsofthesystem.com/app/dashboard) page.

1. Obtain friend code from another user.
2. On friends page, paste code into the "New Friend Request" field.
3. Click Send.

Your friend will receive a notification and will have the opportunity to accept or reject the
request.

## Creating Groups

* Open a browser and navigate to the [Groups](https://agentsofthesystem.com/app/groups) page.

If you have not already added some friends, then you will not have anyone to add to a group but groups
may still be created with just your user to start.

1. Create a new group with the "New Group" button.
2. New Groups only need a name to be created, but be sure to name each group something useful and unique.
   Groups with the same name by the same group owner are not allowed.

One the group is created in your account, you are considered the owner which means you have sole discretion
over whom is added by your, and accepting or rejecting requests of others.

## Interacting with Groups.

The group owner may add existing friends to the group.  The system will dis-allow a friend from being added
twice.

To do this:

1. Find the group you want to add friend(s) to.
2. Click the "Members" button. This will expand the group.
3. Click the "Add Friend(s) to Group" button.
4. Select one or more friends. To select more, shift-click.
5. Click submit.

WARNING:
* There are limitations to how many users may be added to a group if that group is shared to an agent.
  The system will prevent the user from adding users that would put the group over the share limit.

A friend may request to add someone to the group.  If that occurs, the group owner must approve or reject the
request.  The person being added to the group does not necessarily have to be a direct friend of the group
owner.  It could be a friend of a friend.

As the requestor:

1. Find the group you want to request to add friend(s) to.
2. Click the "Members" button. This will expand the group.
3. Click "Invite Friend(s) to Group"
4. Select one or more friends to add.
5. Click Submit.

As the group owner:

1. Find the group you want to add friend(s) to.
2. Click the "Members" button. This will expand the group.
3. Find the request in the separate requests table.
4. Click either accept or reject.

The group table uses will designate whom within the group is one of your friends.  You are free to
remove a friend at-will, and friends are allowed to leave a group at-will.

To remove a group if you are the group owner:

1. Find the group you want to remove friend(s) from.
2. Click the "Members" button. This will expand the group.
3. Find the user you wish to remove.
4. Click "Remove from Group" in the action menu

WARNING:
* There are ramifications of removing a user from a group.  If that user is removed from a group which is
  shared to an agent, then that user will no longer have access to the agent.

## Disbanding Groups

Deleting a group may be done only by the group owner.

1. Find the group you want to disband / delete.
2. In the action menu, click "Disband Group".

The group will be deleted, all members will no longer be group members, and any shares with agents
will be removed as well.
