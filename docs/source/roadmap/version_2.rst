Version 2.0 - Beta
==================

This next version of Agents of The System, the author sought to increase the number of features and
build a tool that others would be able to use in a practical sense.

The primary features of this version are:

1. Automated health and update checking for agents and dedicated servers.
2. Activity logs for agents and dedicated servers.
3. Expand the number of dedicated servers that can be managed with Agent Smith.
4. Expanded email notifications for users.
5. Addition of user preference for email notifications.

more robust.
