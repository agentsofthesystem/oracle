# Agent Smith - Introduction

Agent Smith is a computer application which runs in the system tray of your computer.  For Windows, that is the
bottom right.  The application is a PyQt Graphical User Interface (GUI) with a server backend which is capable of
managing dedicated game servers.  Agent Smith gets its name from the fact that it is effectively agent software that
acts on behalf of the user via the GUI, or if the user wishes The Architect can control it.  Some functionality
the Agent has includes the ability to install, uninstall, and update any supported server.  The agent also has
configuration options which allow it to connect to The Architect securely.
