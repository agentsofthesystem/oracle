Version 1.0 - Alpha
===================

While initially developing Agents of The System, the author was asked the question; "What's the station wagon look like?".

To me, the absolute bare minimum was enough to:

1. Share dedicated game server administration with a group of friends.
2. Manually install and update dedicated game servers.
3. Provide a framework to easily add additional servers as desired or needed.
4. Have a way to know when a server update was needed.

This first version really is bare bones with no real automation of tasks.  Those automation features
are planned for the second release.
