# How Subscriptions Work

This section will explain the differences between unpaid and paid subscriptions for the architect.

Please visit the pricing table on the [Agents of The System](https://agentsofthesystem.com/pricing) for
a quick reference.

## Subscribing

Getting a red-pill subscription entitles the user to the extended privileges defined in the pricing table.

### How to subscribe

Head over to the [Accounts](https://agentsofthesystem.com/pricing) page and select the "Billing" tab.
Once on the tab, click "Subsribe".

The user is taken to a stripe encrypted portal where payment information is provided.  After finishing
the user's information is taken, payment made, and you are returned back to the Accounts page.

## Unsubscribing

### How to un-subscribe

Head over to the [Accounts](https://agentsofthesystem.com/pricing) page and select the "Billing" tab, and then
click on "Customer Portal". The user is taken to a stripe encrypted portal where details about the current
subscription is kept.  Click the "Cancel Plan" button.  You will need to confirm the action.

Keep in mind, cancelling does not immediately revert the user back to Blue Pill status.  If there is time left
in the billing period, you still get that because it has already been paid for.  Once the end of the billing
period is reached, the system will automatically update and revert the user.

### What happens when user un-subscribes

A number of different things happen when a user unsubscribes.  The Architect is still usable but it reverts itself
back to the Blue Pill status and privileges every free user gets.

The following happens when the subscription ends:

1. All agents except for one are marked inactive.  The user can only delete them or re-active the agent if the
   subscription is later resumed.
2. All previous shares across all of your agents are removed.  Don't worry, you can add them back but at the
   free tier limits.
3. All monitors are disabled and any existing faults for them are deleted.

## Subscription Features

The following describes in detail each subscription feature from the pricing page.

### Maximum number of Agents.

Without a subscription, the user may only have a single agent that is owned.  This doesn't necessarily mean only
one agent will appear.  Other agents may appear if shared from another account.

With a subscription, this limit is increased to 6.

A limit is placed even with a subscription to discourage mis-use of this tool.  If the agent limit was not present
then, in theory, someone might add hundreds or thousands of agents and mis-use the tool.

### Dedicated Server Limits

Without a subscription, when viewing the agent information page, only a single dedicated server will appear in
the server table.

When subscribed, an unlimited number of servers are allowed.

Keep in mind, however, if you try to run a large number of servers on your own hardware that might prove
over taxing.

### Agent Share Limits

Without a subscription, agents may only be shared out to a maximum of 2 unique users across a group or individual
friend memberships.

When subscribed, this limit is increased to 10.

### Activity Logs

Without a subscription, the user may only see the last 3 activity logs for a given agent.

With a subscription, the user will have access to everything!

### Manual Controls

With or without a subscription users will have the ability to manually control dedicated servers visible in
the agent information page.

### Email Alerts

With or without a subscription users will receive email alerts and notifications for a given pre-programmed
event.

### Discord

Everyone gets to come see us on our Discord! Come by and say hello!

### Agent & Server Monitors

Only paying users get access to automation features, so agent and dedicated server monitors are only for
subscribed users.
